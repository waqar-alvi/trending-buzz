      <h2>What to expect</h2>
      <p>
        The Champions League kickoff brings heavyweight fixtures — title-holders and perennial favourites face tough opponents in matchday one. With the expanded format, fans have more games and more storylines early in the season.
      </p>

      <h2>Stan Sport coverage</h2>
      <p>
        In Australia, Stan Sport has become the home for every match — live, on demand and in some cases 4K replays and extras. If you’re in Stan’s region, the schedule brings big matchups such as Liverpool vs Atlético and other top clashes.
      </p>

      <h2>Why it matters</h2>
      <p>
        The new format and broadcasting deals reshuffle how fans access matches worldwide. The return offers a feast of football and sets the tone for who looks strongest early on.
