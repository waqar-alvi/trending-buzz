      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
        This match is vital for both sides' hopes of progressing from Group B. With similar points tallies and limited group games, every result impacts the standing and net run-rates.
      </p>

      <h2>Players to watch</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Afghanistan</strong> — spine of experienced spinners and power hitters who can change momentum in quick bursts.</li>
        <li><strong>Bangladesh</strong> — seasoned campaigners who know how to manage pressure in big games; expect clinical middle-over performances.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pitch & conditions</h2>
      <p>
        The Abu Dhabi surface often rewards bowlers who can vary pace; spinners may play a role under lights while batters aim to score early.
      </p>

      <h2>Prediction thread</h2>
      <p>
        Both teams are evenly matched on paper — toss and execution on the day will be decisive. Slight edge might go to the side that manages death overs better.
