      <h2>What triggered the row?</h2>
      <p>
        After the India-Pakistan match, a handshake incident and subsequent claims about instructions given by the match referee sparked a formal complaint from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). The PCB has demanded the immediate removal of Andy Pycroft and lodged a complaint with the ICC alleging inappropriate conduct surrounding the incident.
      </p>

      <h2>How the ICC might react</h2>
      <p>
        According to reporting, the ICC is likely to review the complaint but may not accede to immediate replacement — procedural checks and the referee’s own report will influence any decision. Quick decisions are rare because of governance and the need for due process.
      </p>

      <h2>Implications</h2>
      <p>
        The dispute escalates tensions around high-profile fixtures and highlights how off-field incidents can quickly inflame tournament relations. For fans and administrators, the episode raises questions about match protocols, neutral officiating and communication after contentious moments.
