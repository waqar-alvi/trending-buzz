      <h2>Quick result</h2>
      <p>
        Sri Lanka chased down Hong Kong's total to secure a win in their Group B encounter. The chase was tidy — Sri Lanka paced the innings efficiently and wrapped up the match with overs to spare, showing the experience advantage over the associate side.
      </p>

      <h2>What happened (brief)</h2>
      <p>
        Hong Kong posted a competitive total after some energetic lower-order hitting, but Sri Lanka’s top-order and a steady middle order took control during the chase. A few tidy overs from Sri Lanka’s bowlers kept the required rate manageable and negated Hong Kong’s big-hitting late in the innings.
      </p>

      <h2>Key performers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sri Lanka batter</strong> — anchored the chase and provided a calm hand at the crease.</li>
        <li><strong>Hong Kong quicks</strong> — produced good death over hitting but lacked consistent breakthroughs.</li>
        <li><strong>Fielding moments</strong> — Sri Lanka’s fielding saved crucial singles and put pressure on the chase.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        The match highlighted the gulf in experience: Sri Lanka’s game management in the chase contrasted with Hong Kong’s brilliance in patches but lack of sustained pressure. For Sri Lanka it was a businesslike win; for Hong Kong, several positives to build on had they maintain control in the powerplay and middle overs.
