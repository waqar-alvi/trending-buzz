        <p>
          You don't need a complicated meal plan or expensive supplements to feel better. Small, repeatable changes to how and what you eat can dramatically improve your energy, mood, and focus.
          Below are practical, science-aligned healthy eating hacks you can start using today — no fads, no guilt.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Start with protein at breakfast</h2>
        <p>
          Many people reach for toast or cereal and then hit a mid-morning slump. Adding a quality protein — like Greek yogurt, eggs, cottage cheese, or a plant-based protein smoothie — helps stabilize blood sugar
          and keeps hunger at bay. Aim for 15–25g of protein within an hour of waking for steady energy through the morning.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Prioritize whole, minimally processed foods</h2>
        <p>
          Swap refined carbs (white bread, standard pastries) for whole grains (oats, quinoa, brown rice) and add vegetables wherever possible.
          Whole foods are more nutrient-dense and digest slower, which keeps your energy more even across the day.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Use the "plate rule" to balance meals</h2>
        <p>
          Visual rules are easy to follow: fill half your plate with vegetables, one quarter with lean protein, and one quarter with whole grains or starchy vegetables.
          This simple guideline guarantees fiber, protein, and complex carbs — a balanced trio for energy and satiety.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Swap sugary snacks for smart alternatives</h2>
        <p>
          Instead of candy or soda, reach for a handful of nuts, a piece of fruit with nut butter, or plain yogurt with berries. These options provide natural sweetness plus protein and healthy fats to prevent the crash that follows sugar binges.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Hydration is non-negotiable</h2>
        <p>
          Mild dehydration can feel like fatigue. Make water your default beverage. If plain water bores you, infuse it with lemon, cucumber, or mint. Aim for steady sips throughout the day — a helpful reminder: keep
          a water bottle visible and within reach.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Plan one "prep session" per week</h2>
        <p>
          Spend 45–60 minutes prepping a few basics: cooked grains, roasted vegetables, hard-boiled eggs, or a big salad base. Having ready-to-eat components reduces decision fatigue and keeps you from resorting to processed convenience foods.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Add healthy fats to each meal</h2>
        <p>
          Avocado, olive oil, nuts, and seeds slow digestion and help you absorb fat-soluble vitamins. They also add flavor and satisfaction — a small amount can make a meal feel complete.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Use spices — they’re tiny powerhouses</h2>
        <p>
          Turmeric, cinnamon, ginger, and black pepper can enhance flavor and offer metabolic and inflammatory benefits. Cinnamon on oats or turmeric in a savory bowl is an easy health upgrade.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Be strategic with caffeine</h2>
        <p>
          Caffeine boosts focus but can disrupt sleep if overused. Limit caffeine to earlier in the day and avoid stacking multiple strong doses. A mid-morning coffee paired with protein usually provides a good lift.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Practice mindful eating</h2>
        <p>
          Eating quickly increases the chance of overeating and poor digestion. Try to eat without screens occasionally — even a 10–minute mindful meal helps your brain register fullness and improves digestion.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Don't fear leftovers — repurpose smartly</h2>
        <p>
          Leftover roasted vegetables become a quick stir-fry; cooked beans turn into a filling salad base. Repurposing reduces waste and keeps you on track with nutritious choices.
        </p>

        <h2>12. When you travel, pack the basics</h2>
        <p>
          Going out? Pack a small kit: a bag of nuts, a fruit, and an instant protein powder sachet. Small choices while traveling preserve your energy and prevent impulsive fast-food runs.
        </p>

        <h2>Sample day: easy-to-follow menu</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Greek yogurt with berries + tablespoon of flaxseed.</li>
          <li><strong>Lunch:</strong> Grain bowl — quinoa, roasted veggies, chickpeas, tahini drizzle.</li>
          <li><strong>Snack:</strong> Apple slices + almond butter.</li>
          <li><strong>Dinner:</strong> Baked salmon, steamed greens, sweet potato.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final notes — consistency beats perfection</h2>
        <p>
          The best “diet” is the one you can stick to. Focus on making two or three small changes this week (protein at breakfast, one prep session, and a hydration habit). After a few weeks, these tiny shifts add up to big, lasting results.
